wview (5.21.7-1local1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  This version introduces several notable changes that apply to new
  installations of this package:
  * This package now creates the wview system user in postinst and runs all
    daemons as this user instead of root.
  * Files in /var/lib/wview and /etc/wview are owned by wview.
  * Files in /etc/wview are only writable by wview, with the exception of
    /etc/wview/export which is world-writable and sticky, and
    /etc/wview/wview-user which is only root-writable.

  No attempt is made to change the users or permissions of existing files due
  to the wide possible variations of configuration.  To update an existing
  default installation, the following commands should be sufficient:

      adduser --system --group --home /var/lib/wview wview
      chown -R wview:wview /var/lib/wview
      chmod -R ug+rwX /var/lib/wview
      chgrp -R wview /etc/wview
      chmod -R g+rwX,o-w /etc/wview
      chmod 1777 /etc/wview/export
      # Note: /etc/wview/wview-user should only be root-writable
      echo wview > /etc/wview/wview-user
